# Template Engine - Employee Summary

## Description

This is a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

The application will prompt the user for information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members. After each team member the user is asked if they would like to add another team member. If they select yes, it will prompt them for the next team member's information. If the user selects no, an HTML file will be created with all of the team members information. 

When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. For each team member entered a card will display with their name, role, ID, and role specific property (office number, link to GitHub profile, or school). This application also utilizes test files to make sure the app is running appropriately.
