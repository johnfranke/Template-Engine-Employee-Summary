# Template Engine - Employee Summary

## Description

This is a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

The user will build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This application also utilizes test files to make sure the app is running appropriately.

When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. For each team member entered a card will display with their name, role, ID, and role specific property (office number, link to GitHub profile, or school).
